# SpeakerPoop

This script prevents your Bluetooth speaker from automatically turning off.

You need to keep this script running in a terminal, so that it can periodically play a short white noise to keep the speaker active. I made this less boring by displaying a random Chinese Tang poet line every time it plays the noise.
